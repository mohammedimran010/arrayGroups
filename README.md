Coding Challenge
The goal of this exercise is to write some executable code.

Implement a function or class that can be called on to provide the following behaviour:
Given an array of length >= 0, and a positive integer N, return the contents of the array divided into N equally sized arrays.
Where the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal to the remainder.
